The key to applying the Strategy pattern is designing interfaces for the strategy and its context that are general enough to support a range of algorithms. You shouldn't have to change the strategy or context interface to support a new algorithm.

It makes the design pattern Strategy useful for dealing with problems where the code need to be reusability and ease of maintenance are important, like the [sample code in java](./StrategyWithJava/).
