The book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software" presents several advantages of using the Strategy design pattern. Some of them are:

- Flexibility: The Strategy pattern allows the behavior of an object to be changed at runtime, without affecting other objects that use the same object.

- Code reusability: The Strategy pattern separates the algorithm from the object that uses it, making it easy to reuse in other contexts.

- Eases maintenance: As the algorithms are isolated in separate classes, it is easier to make modifications to a specific algorithm without affecting the rest of the system.

- Improves readability: The use of the Strategy pattern makes the code more readable and easier to understand, since the behavior is separated into separate classes.

- Facilitates software evolution: By allowing algorithms to be easily modified or replaced, the Strategy pattern facilitates software evolution, allowing it to adapt to new requirements or changes in the environment.

It makes the design pattern Strategy useful for dealing with problems where the code need to be reusability and ease of maintenance are important, like the [sample code in java](./StrategyWithJava/).
